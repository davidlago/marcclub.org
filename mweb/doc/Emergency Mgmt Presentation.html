Michael Goldfarb, Acting Planning Manager for the Montgomery County Office of Emergency Management and Homeland Security came to our December 18 club meeting to talk about the organization and planning for emergency operations in Montgomery County.<p>Michael oversees the department’s planning efforts including the recent revision of the county’s emergency operations plan.  He also manages the department’s community outreach efforts.<p>Michael worked in the emergency operations center during numerous activations including severe summer storms, hurricanes, the Derecho, and two presidential inaugurations, so his insights were especially valuable and interesting to club members.  His presentation was followed by a lively question and answer session, which even after the meeting officially adjourned continued in several informal groups.<p>He was kind enough to share his presentation slides with us,
