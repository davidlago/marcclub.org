Script for the Sunday Night MARC Net





Good evening!  It is 7:30 and time to begin the regular weekly net on
the 146.955 repeater sponsored by MARC, the Montgomery Amateur Radio
Club.  The net control station for this evening's net is 

     [  **your callsign**  ]
     
and my name is 

     [  **your name**  ].
     
This is a directed net which means all communications between stations
should be directed through the net control station.

This net is a regularly scheduled MARC event which begins at 7:30 p.m.
every Sunday to provide members and guests an opportunity to hear about
past and future club activities and other items of interest related to
amateur radio.  All hams are welcome to participate.

This weekly net operates in conjunction with MARC's two monthly meetings
held on the 1st and 3rd Wednesdays of each month.  Meetings begin at
7:30 PM and are held in the Stella B. Werner Council Office Building
cafeteria at 100 Maryland Ave. in Rockville, MD.  The next regular MARC
meeting will be held on

   [  **date** ] .
   
The program will be

   [  **identify program** ]
by

   [  **name/callsign** ]. 
   
For specific meeting information, please contact net control during the
net or call on this repeater on the day of the meeting.

We will now begin taking check-ins.  When you check-in, please say your 
call sign slowly and include your name.

Any stations who would like to check-in, please call now.

     [Acknowledge check-ins.]

     [Make any other announcements for the net here-- MARC Mini News
      is a good source of information-- classes, hamfests, contests,
      etc.  Try to summarize the information rather than read the
      complete article.]

We'll now go through the list of stations who checked in and give
everyone the opportunity to make any comments or announcements.  

     [Call each station 
      start with any mobiles/portables 
      invite them to make a comment.]

     [Ask for more check-ins and comments before starting
      the Newsline or Audio News]
      
Please standby for the Amateur Radio Newsline (or ARRL Audio News.)

     [Play the ARRL Audio News or the Amateur Radio Newsline]

I'll now pause for any last minute check-ins or stations with any
additional information for the net.

     [Acknowledge check-ins and invite them to make a comment.]

There were 

   [ **number** ]
   
stations checked in to tonight's net and everyone is
thanked for their participation.  MARC looks forward to seeing you at
its monthly meetings and hearing you on the weekly net.  This concludes
this weekly club event.  This is

   [  **your call sign** ]
   
closing the net andreturning the KV3B MARC repeater to
regular amateur use.  Good evening and 73!
