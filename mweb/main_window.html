Marty Pittinger KB3MXM, an official from ARRL, attended our meeting last week. Among the things he discussed was the importance of supporting <b>H.R. 1301</b> in the House and <b>S 1685</b> in the Senate, entitled <b><i>The Amateur Radio Parity Act of 2015</b></i>.<br>
This law requires "reasonable accommodation" for Amateur Radio communications with respect to overly restrictive provisions
of land use, such as with Homeowners Associations who apply an unnecessarily heavy hand in limiting Amateur Radio communications among its homeowners.    
Find the <a href="http://www.arrl.org/amateur-radio-parity-act" target="_blank">texts of the bills and further details here</a>,
including draft letters and where to send your letter recommending support of the bills.

"Squad Radios from Omaha Beach to Heartbreak Ridge to Ia Drang Valley" was the title of the excellent presentation by Gene AD3F to the Montgomery Amateur Radio Club.
