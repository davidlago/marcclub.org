Carl WB3HAD and Carlos K8CRS presented an overview of Montgomery County's Community Emergency Response Teams, also known as CERT.  There has been a lot of interest recently in CERTs.  We even had a visitor drive all the up from Richmond to hear the very informative presentation, which was followed by an equally informative and valuable question and answer session.  A copy of the slides from the presentation can be <a target="_blank"

Dick WN3R presented a very valuable and detailed overview of remote station control.  He was a fountain of information, giving examples of types of equipment to consider, antennas, installation and even hints on computer programming.  He also shared detailed photos of his own home remote station set up, sprinkled with humorous asides about his various "lessons learned" the hard way. His presentation was enthusiastically received and followed up by numerous questions from the audience.

  Auxiliary Communications Service &mdash; History, Current Status and Vision for the Future &mdash; was the topic of the very timely and interesting presentation. Presenters included Ben K3RYR, Al KN3U, Carl WB3HAD, Tom W3TDH and William W3QX.<br>
