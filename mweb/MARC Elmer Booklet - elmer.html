<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You are about
to discover that you have chosen a hobby that is only limited by
one's imagination. How is that for a blanket statement? Well, it is
true. Amateur (Ham) Radio is all about <B>communication</B>. How you
choose to communicate and what you say is up to you (with only a few
common sense restrictions). </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You will soon
be able to make friends with people around the world or even carry on
a conversation with astronauts in space. If you are technically
inclined, you have opened the door to experimentation, and if you are
not, you'll pick up a little &quot;know how&quot; along the way.
You'll soon discover that you do not need an electronics degree to
get a license; just a willingness to learn. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;What is
an Elmer&quot; is probably the first thing that you want to know.
That same question was asked recently at a club meeting which I
attended. Simply put, an Elmer is anyone willing to teach you
something about Ham Radio. In other words, practically every Ham you
meet can, in some way, serve as your Elmer. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This booklet
was originally prepared in 1986 by Jeff Horlick (KZ3F) with help from
Ron Rubin (then N3KQY) as a teaching tool for newcomers, and as a
handy reference guide. You should find that it addresses many of the
questions that you might have as you are first getting started. The
revised booklet (which you are now reading) includes several
technical articles by Harry H. Ricker III (KC3MX) and other members
of the Montgomery Amateur Radio Club. At first glance, all of this
material may be a bit overwhelming, but just keep in mind that this
information will be useful to you, both now and in the years to come.

Radio Service is for individuals who are interested in the technical
side of radio and are able to provide emergency communications in
disasters, all for the general benefit of the public. It is called
&quot;amateur&quot; because it is strictly non-commercial; no
business may be transmitted on amateur frequencies. The Amateur Radio

passing <A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications
Commission</A> (FCC) examinations for the three progressive levels

General, and Extra. (Note: Two other classes of license, Novice and
Advanced, still exist for licenses granted before April 15, 2000. No
new licenses for these designations are now being granted.) Exams
include tests of applicants understanding of the technical and
practical aspects of the Amateur Radio Service. The higher the class,

<H2 CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What
Is A Repeater?</FONT></H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You have
probably heard the term repeater used by hams when they say, &quot;I'll
meet you on the 9-5-5 repeater&quot;, but you are uncertain as to
what they are talking about. Simply put; a repeater is a means of
extending the range of a radio signal by retransmitting (repeating)
it. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An example of
an ideal application of a repeater would be when two people would
like to communicate with each other, but they each live in a valley
with a huge mountain between them. It is a safe bet that they will
not be able to talk to each other, because radio waves are blocked by
that mountain. The solution is a simple one; put up a repeater on the
top of the mountain. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The repeater
operates when you transmit on one frequency, and it receives your
signal and retransmits it on a different frequency. For example, to
communicate with the ham on the other side of the mountain, you might
both transmit to the repeater on 146.355 mHz and you would be able to
hear each other on 146.955 mHz, which is the frequency that the
transmitter retransmits both of your signals on. All modern day VHF
and UHF radios are equipped to transmit on one frequency and receive
on another. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Don't for a
moment think that repeaters are limited to only mountainous regions.
In areas like Washington, DC, we use repeaters to extend the coverage
areas of low power radios like hand-held walkie-talkies (HTs) or
mobile rigs (mounted in automobiles, boats, bicycles, airplanes,
etc.) If you were to transmit directly to someone with say 5 watts of
power, your coverage might be limited to 5 miles. A repeater, which
has a very sensitive receiver, would be able to hear that low power
signal and retransmit it at a power of perhaps 100 watts. So someone
living in Gaithersburg who would normally be limited to talking with
someone in Rockville, might utilize a repeater and be able to
converse with someone in Springfield, Viriginia. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Repeaters are
also used as a gathering place for Hams. It is not unusual to hear
several hams conversing as a group during their morning and afternoon
commuting. It is a great way to meet people, disseminate information,
and ask for solutions to technical problems. The next section, taken
from the ARRL repeater guide informs you of proper repeater
etiquette. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A repeater is
often used for public service activities. During times of emergency
(severe weather, etc.) repeaters are used by civil defense authorized
groups, such as RACES (the Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service), to
relay information and to coordinate relief efforts. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Repeaters can
also be used to provide communication support for walkathons and
other community events. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many repeaters
have &quot;auto-patch&quot; capabilities which allow you to make
telephone calls of a non-business nature in instances where phone
service is not readily available. This can be done using a simple
hand-held or mobile radio, and can come in handy in times of
emergency. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You will come
to appreciate the many uses of repeaters, and you will also find that
they are a great source of fun and lively conversation. </FONT>

<H2 CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">INTRODUCTION
TO PACKET RADIO</FONT></H2>
<H3 CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">by
Larry Kenney, WB9LOZ (from W3INK BBS)<BR>revised by KB3CS</FONT></H3>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Packet Radio is
a relatively recent development in the world of Amateur Radio. If you
haven't already been caught by the &quot;packet bug&quot;, you're
probably wondering what it's all about and why so many people are so
excited about it. Well, continue reading, because you're about to
find out. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Packet seems to
offer something different from other facets of Amateur Radio, yet it
can be used for everything from a local QSO to a DX contact hundreds
of miles away (on 2 meters!), for electronic mail, message
transmission, emergency communications, or just plain tinkering in
the world of digital communications. It presents a new challenge for
those tired of the QRM on the low bands, a new mode for those already
on FM, and a better, faster means of message handling for those on
RTTY. Packet is for the rag chewer, the traffic handler, the
experimenter, and the casual operator. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A ham can get
involved very easily with relatively small out-of-pocket expenses.
All you need is a 2-meter transceiver, a computer or terminal and a
TNC. Alternatively, a 2-meter transceiver, a computer with serial
port and sound card, an inexpensive computer-radio interface
(&ldquo;<A HREF="http://www.westmountainradio.com/">RIGblaster</A>&rdquo;
or equivalent) and DSP software (&ldquo;<A HREF="http://www.mixw.net/">MixW</A>&rdquo;
or equivalent). You probably already have the two meter rig and a
computer of some kind, so all you need to buy is the TNC for a bit
more than $100 or a computer-radio interface (about $60) and DSP
software (about $40), The TNC is the Terminal Node Controller, the
little black box that's wired between the computer and the radio. It
acts very much like a modem when connecting a computer to the phone
lines. It converts the data from the computer into AFSK tones for
transmission and changes the tones received by the radio into data
for the computer. Whichever method you use, TNC or DSP, it's a simple
matter of wiring up a plug and a couple jacks to become fully
operational. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Packet is
communications between people either direct or indirect. You can work
keyboard to keyboard or use electronic mailboxes or bulletin board
systems to leave messages. Due to the error checking by the TNC, all
of it is error free, too. (That is, as error free as the person at
the keyboard types it.) As the data is received it's continuously
checked for errors, and it isn't accepted unless it's correct. You
don't miss the information if it has errors, however, because the
information is resent again. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The data that
is to be transmitted is collected in the TNC and sent as bursts, or
packets, of information; hence the name. Each packet has the callsign
or address of who it's going to, who it's coming from and the route
between the two stations included, along with the data and error
checking. Since up to 256 characters can be included in each packet,
more than three lines of text can be sent in a matter of a couple
seconds. There is plenty of time between packets for several stations
to be using the same frequency at the same time. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If all of this
sounds confusing, don't let it bother you, because that little black
box, the TNC, does everything for you automatically. Packet might
seem very confusing at first, but in a day or two you're in there
with the best of them. Mailboxes, bulletin board systems, and the
packet networks allow you to work stations hundreds of miles away
using just a low powered rig on 2 meters or 70 cm. The world of
packet radio awaits you! </FONT>

<H2 CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GETTING
ON THE AIR WITH AMATEUR RADIO</FONT></H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After you have
passed your license test and the VE has forwarded your completed Form
610 to the FCC, you have perhaps a few days before your license is
issued via the Internet. As soon as you see your license application
has been granted, print out the report from the <A HREF="http://wireless.fcc.gov/uls/">FCC
Universal Licensing System (ULS)</A> database for your records. The
official license document from the FCC can take six to twelve weeks
to arrive by mail. This article will help you plan and set up a two
meter mobile station and a simple HF station at home. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Getting on two
meters is the easiest first step. You can buy a complete self
contained amateur radio station in the form of a two meter handheld
or HT. This comes complete with speaker, microphone, antenna, and
power supply in one tiny handheld package. When you buy your first
handheld, be sure that it includes a battery charger as part of the
basic package. Buy a second battery so you will always have a fully
charged battery available. This basic HT package is fine for use at
home and for pedestrian mobile operation near a repeater. But for
mobile operation in a car, you will need an external mobile antenna,
a power adapter, and a speaker microphone. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A disadvantage
of the HT is that it does not work well inside a car. You will need a
5/8 or 1/4 wave external antenna for your car. Choose a 1/4 wave
model if you have a garage for your car or use a parking garage
regularly. Purchase a cigarette lighter adapter to power your HT in
the car so you will not have to operate using the HT battery. A
speaker-microphone is recommended for use in the car because it is
easier to operate than the entire HT while driving. The HT system
described above is recommended because it gives you the flexibility
to operate pedestrian mobile, for example at a public service event,
as well as in your car. It is a good way to start in amateur radio on
two meters. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Setting up an
HF station in your home sounds simple but you will have to carefully
plan your system in order to achieve good results. Your station will
consist of an antenna, RF transmission line, HF transceiver, and
accessories. Your single most important decision is your choice of an
antenna. Choose a 10 meter dipole for your first antenna. It is
small, only 16 feet long, and can be easily constructed from simple
materials. It can be used indoors as an attic dipole, or outside
between two trees. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Think about how
you will mount the antenna before you begin construction. Use a tape
measure to verify that you have enough space. Determine where you
will place your transceiver and where you will mount the antenna, and
then measure the distance needed to feed your antenna. Buy a
preassembled RG-58 coaxial cable assembly with the PL-259 connectors
attached. Be sure it is longer than your distance measurement by
about 10 feet to insure it is long enough. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You may be
tempted to buy an expensive new HF transceiver. But before you do,
visit a hamfest to see what is available. Check used equipment
advertisements and call local ham stores to find out what used
equipment they have. A used transceiver about 10 years old should
cost you about $550 to $650. This is half what you will pay for a new
rig. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Consider a tube
type transceiver if you are technically inclined and have a good
knowledge of electronics. A solid state transceiver is a good choice
if you are uncomfortable with a complicated tune-up procedure, and
prefer simple no-tune operation. </FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For your first
rig, you should select a transceiver which offers simple operation.
Don't make your choice based on the number of memories or the number
of features, make your choice practical. Select a transceiver which
has the basic necessities such as: all band coverage, a narrow band
CW filter, good sounding audio, and above all a reputation for
performance. Ask questions when you negotiate the purchase. Talk to
experienced amateur operators and get their opinions before you
decide which rig to buy. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A meter capable
of both power an SWR measurements is a necessity. You will need one
to tune your antenna and verify operation of your transceiver. This
meter should be capable of operation in both the HF and VHF frequency
bands. A microphone usually is provided with the transceiver, but you
will have to buy a CW key. A straight key is best for starting out.
While most modern transceivers have internal speakers, they are
usually not adequate. You should get a large high quality speaker for
your transceiver to improve its audio output. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Optional
accessories which you should consider purchasing but are not
necessary are a 24 hour clock which can be set to universal time, a
world map showing DX countries and call signs, an ARRL type logbook,
and an antenna tuner. A low pass filter will be needed for older tube
type radios which do not include an internal low pass filter. Most
solid state transceivers have internal filters. A high pass TVI
filter for your TV set may be needed if your family will be watching
TV while you operate. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After you have
assembled your station, you will want to fire it up to see how it
works. A dummy load antenna will allow you to do this without
transmitting a signal on the air. Practice tuning up your transceiver
into a dummy load before you load into an antenna. Before getting on
the air, you will need to practice sending CW. Use your transceiver's
CW sidetone to practice sending CW. Turn the power down to zero
output or transmit into a dummy load. When you practice sending CW,
write up a script for a typical QSO which includes your name,
location (QTH), equipment you are using (rig) and comments on your
age and the weather (WX). Practice sending requests like, please send
slowly (QRS), please repeat your name, your QTH again please QRM, and
missed your last transmission. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Practicing this
will help you to get through your first CW QSOs. </FONT>

<H2 CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">TUNING
YOUR ANTENNA</FONT></H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The fun part of
antenna building is the design, construction, and erection of your
antenna. Antenna design and construction is one of the most creative
activities of amateur radio. But, every antenna project faces a
critical moment of truth when RF power is applied to the antenna and
the SWR is measured. If you think that your new antenna should work
perfect the first time you apply power, you will probably be
disappointed when you discover that the antenna SWR is higher than
you planned. Even if you carefully calculated the length of the
antenna, and measured the length very carefully, you are likely to
find that the SWR is not acceptable. You will need to tune your
antenna. Tuning is the hardest part of antenna construction and this
article will help you do it quickly. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The most
important step in tuning your antenna is to design a tuning method
for your antenna when you are planning its design and construction.
During the design phase, determine how you will adjust the length of
the antenna elements. If your antenna is a dipole, you will need to
change the lengths of the two sides of the antenna. You will also
need to lower the antenna to the ground in order to make the
adjustments. If your antenna design must work the first time without
any adjustments, then it is not a very good design. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your design
should include a method of lowering the antenna for tuning
adjustments, and a means for adjusting the element lengths. When you
raise your antenna the first time, do not make it difficult to adjust
the element lengths. Make sure you leave some wire at the ends for
making your antenna longer, and do not tie the wire into knots that
require a lot of effort to change when you trim the antenna. I
suggest that you install the end insulators after you have found the
correct length of your antenna. Use thin rope through loops in the
antenna wire to hold up your antenna during tuning, and attach the
insulators after you have determined the correct length. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before you
apply RF power to your new antenna system, make sure that you
carefully inspect all your connections and the connectors. Use a
volt-ohm-meter to check for shorts in your transmission line by
measuring between the conductors. Also check to be sure that you have
installed the connector properly by checking for continuity between
the connector and the antenna elements. After everything checks out
OK, connect your transmission line to the antenna jack of your SWR
meter and the transceiver to its jack. Then set your transceiver to
CW mode, tune to the desired antenna center frequency, and adjust the
output power to minimum. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Set the SWR
meter for minimum sensitivity and key your transceiver. Adjust your
SWR meter sensitivity for a full scale reading. If necessary,
increase the transmitter power setting until you achieve a full scale
reading. You should always use the minimum power needed to achieve a
full scale reading so that you don't cause interference. When you
transmit to make SWR measurements, be sure to check that the
frequency is not being used by other stations. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your first SWR
reading should tell you whether the antenna is working. Set your
first test frequency to the design center frequency of your antenna.
If your SWR measurement is off the measurement scale, usually greater
than 5, then there is probably something seriously wrong with your
antenna that tuning will not correct. Check your connectors and the
connections at the feed point. Usually a very high SWR reading
indicates either a short or an open circuit. You may have a cold
solder joint somewhere in the system so reapply the soldering iron if
you can't quickly find the problem. A common problem is the shield
shorted to the center conductor in PL-239 type connectors. Also check
to see that you have soldered the center conductor properly and that
the center conductor is not broken. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If your first
reading gives a low SWR of near 1, then you are very lucky. But,
don't assume that everything is OK. Your antenna may not be working
even when you have a low SWR. Check the SWR across the band. You
should see the SWR readings rise as you increase and decrease the
frequency from the design center frequency. If you don't verify a
rise in SWR as you move away from the center frequency, then you have
a problem in your antenna. It usually occurs when the antenna has
fallen back down on the ground by accident. If your measurements show
that the SWR behaves correctly, you have successfully completed your
antenna. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If your first
SWR measurement is between 2.5 and 5, you may have a problem that
can't be corrected by tuning. SWR's in this range are too high to be
caused by tuning error, and may be caused by bad connections at the
feed or by unequal element lengths. Lower your antenna and verify
that the feed connections are good and remeasure the element lengths
to verify that they are correct. If everything checks out OK, then
you may have a problem with the location of your antenna. If it is
close to metal objects, trees, power lines, or wires, you may have
detuned your antenna by locating it near these objects. In this case
tuning may fix the problem. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your goal in
tuning your antenna is to place its resonant frequency at your
desired operating frequency. The resonant frequency is the frequency
for which the SWR is a minimum, usually at an SWR of 1. To decide
whether your antenna is too long or too short you need to measure the
SWR at different frequencies to see how it changes with frequency.
When the antenna is too long, it has a resonant frequency lower than
the design frequency. In this case, the SWR increases as the
measurement frequency is increased from the design frequency. When
the antenna is too short, it has a resonant frequency higher than the
design frequency, and the SWR decreases as the measurement frequency
increases. To determine whether your antenna needs to be lengthened
or shortened, you need to measure the SWR at several frequencies
across the band and record the results. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your
measurement results should show clearly whether your antenna is long
or short, but the hardest part of tuning is determining how much to
lengthen or shorten the antenna. If your SWR is high at the design
frequency, then you will have to make a large change in the length of
the antenna. If the SWR is near 1, then you will make only a small
change in length. The actual amount of the change will depend on the
frequency and the amount by which you need to shift the resonant
frequency. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tables and
formulas which give the length of an antenna for different
frequencies should be used to decide how much to trim your antenna.
Tables and formulas for quarter wave length antennas are recommended
when adjusting dipoles, because they specify the length of the sides
of the dipole, rather than the total length. This simplifies the
calculations, because you don't have to remember to divide your
length corrections by a factor of two. To calculate the tuning
correction, estimate the resonant frequency of your antenna using the
SWR measurements. Then by using the tables or antenna formulas,
determine the antenna length for this frequency. Compare this length
with the length of your antenna. The difference in lengths will tell
you how much to lengthen or shorten your antenna. Remember, that you
shorten the antenna to raise its resonant frequency and lengthen it
to lower its frequency. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After you have
determined the amount of trimming, make the changes and return the
antenna to its position. Repeat the antenna SWR measurements to
determine the new resonant frequency. Your new resonant frequency
should be very close to the desired value. However, if not, trim the
antenna again and repeat the procedure of trimming and measuring SWR
until your antenna is resonant at the desired frequency. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sometimes the
tuning procedure does not yield an SWR of 1 at resonance. In this
case the minimum SWR may be only 1.5. This is OK but, if it is higher
than this you should determine if something is wrong with your
antenna. One thing to check, is to verify that both sides of your
dipole are the same length. It is easy to make a mistake that gives
you a dipole with unequal sides and this will cause the SWR at
resonance to be higher than one. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With some
experience, you should be able to quickly tune all your antenna
projects. Tuning your antenna is the final step that allows you to
achieve good antenna performance. Don't skip this step by thinking
that your antenna tuner will do the job for you. If your antenna is
not properly checked out and tuned, your antenna tuner may be loading
up a malfunctioning antenna. </FONT>

<H2 CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">MEASUREMENT
OF TRANSMITTED POWER</FONT></H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When does an
accurate power meter give the correct output power of your
transmitter? The answer is only when the VSWR is 1:1. This means that
your expensive power meter isn't much better than a cheap one if you
don't use it properly. If your VSWR is high, you may be transmitting
less power than you think, here's why. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If your power
meter reads an output power of 100 watts and a VSWR of 3:1, you might
think that this is your transmitter output power. But you would be
wrong because the reflected power due to the antenna mismatch causes
your meter to include the reflected power along with the transmitter
output power in your meter reading. For a VSWR of 3:1, twenty five
percent of the power your meter reads is reflected power. Therefore,
your transmitter power is 75 watts. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some people
think that the above result must be wrong, because the meter reads
the transmitter output power directly since it is located at the
transmitter output. Furthermore, if the transmitter puts out 75
watts, then why does the meter read 100 watts? The reason is
surprising, the reflected power from the antenna mismatch is
reflected back from the transmitter output and adds to the original
75 watts to give a total of 100 watts at the meter. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When making
power measurements, you must be careful to avoid power measurement
error due to VSWR on your transmission line. There are several ways
to do this. If you can measure the reflected power directly, then you
can measure the forward power and then the reflected power and
subtract the reflected power to obtain the transmitter output.
Another method is to measure the VSWR and the forward power and then
use a chart such as Table 1 to convert VSWR into percent transmitted
power. Table 1 can also be used to find the reflected power by
converting VSWR into percent reflected power. The reflected power is
then subtracted from the forward power. If you don't have a meter
that reads reflected power directly and you don't want to make the
calculation every time you measure power, the following method can be
used.</FONT>

</TABLE>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When you
measure your transmitter power, place your power meter between your
transmitter and your antenna tuner. Before you measure your power,
adjust the VSWR to 1:1 and then take the forward power meter reading.
Because the tuner adjusts the VSWR to 1:1, the power meter reading is
correct. The reflected power in this case is zero. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The above
methods are adequate when you want to know the transmitter output,
but what you really want to know is how much power you are
transmitting from your antenna. If your transmission line has a very
low loss at your transmitting frequency and you don't use a tuner,
the answer is simple. Your transmitted power equals your transmitter
output power which is measured using one of the above measurement
methods. If you use a tuner, the losses in the tuner must be
determined and then the transmitted power is calculated as the ratio
of tuner input power to output power. This ratio is the tuner loss in
decibels converted into a ratio. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If your
transmission line has loss and your VSWR is 1:1, the loss factor is
the ratio of the power measured at your transmitter to the power
transmitted. This ratio is calculated from the matched transmission
line loss by converting from decibels to a ratio. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When your
transmission line has loss in it and the VSWR is not 1:1, the problem
is more complicated. One method is to calculate your transmitted
power as before for the case when the VSWR was 1:1. However, the loss
of the transmission line is higher when the VSWR is greater than 1:1.
The usual method to calculate the transmission line loss when VSWR is
not 1:1 is as follows. First, determine your 1:1 or matched
transmission line loss at your operating frequency by using a loss
table in the ARRL Handbooks. Multiply the loss per foot by the length
of your transmission line. Second, determine the actual VSWR at the
antenna. The ARRL Handbooks give a graph of input VSWR versus load
VSWR to permit you to determine the VSWR at your antenna. The input
VSWR is your measured VSWR at the transmitter. Third, determine the
additional loss due to your VSWR at the antenna, determined in step
two, using the graph of additional loss versus load VSWR in the ARRL
Handbooks. Fourth, add the additional loss to the loss for a matched
line to get the loss for your transmission line. Finally, convert the
transmitter output power into power delivered to the antenna by
converting the loss in decibels to the ratio of transmitter input
power to transmission line output power. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
above method can be simplified by the use of Table 1. For
corresponding values of VSWR, Table 1 gives the values of the
reflection coefficient in decibels as return loss, and the
transmission coefficient in decibels as transmission loss. To find
the power delivered to the antenna the following method is used:</FONT></P>

<H2 CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CALLING
CQ</FONT></H2>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Calling
CQ is the first step in establishing amateur radio communication. You
can answer a CQ sent by another station, or you can call CQ and
listen for an answer. CQ, a radio code from the early days of radio,
is used by radio amateurs as an invitation to establish
communication. The communication established by the CQ call can take
many forms. The communication which is established is called a QSO,
pronounced &ldquo;CUE-so&rdquo;, from the Q-signal. When a QSO has
been completed, an amateur operator refers to the communication as
having &quot;worked the station in a QSO&quot;, or just &quot;worked&quot;
the station. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Operating
procedure manuals have traditionally discouraged the use of the CQ
call. For example, The 1964 ARRL Handbook does not give a procedure
for calling CQ. The Handbook advises you to answer a CQ call but does
not provide instructions for calling CQ. Later versions of the
Handbook correct this deficiency, but advise you to listen for
someone else calling CQ first. Calling CQ is a tradition of amateur
radio. When you want to make a contact with another station, you
should call CQ. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To
avoid interfering with other stations, follow these steps before
calling CQ. First, find a clear frequency - one that is not being
used. Then listen for a minute or two. On phone, key your transceiver
and transmit: &quot;Is this frequency in use?&quot;. On CW transmit,
&quot;QRL?&quot;. Listen for an answer. If none, try again. If you
get an answer, move to another frequency and repeat the process. On
CW you may be answered with the letter &quot;C&quot;, which means -
yes, this frequency is in use. You may also be answered with QRL,
which means the same thing. If you don't get an answer, then the
frequency is clear and you can call CQ. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
CQ call consists of four parts: the CQ code, a qualifier code, your
call sign, and an end code. The CQ code is an invitation to call you.
Without a qualifier code, CQ means that you are inviting any station
to call. When a qualifier code is used, you are transmitting a
qualified invitation. Only stations which meet the qualification are
invited to call. For example, a qualified CQ call used during
contests is, CQ Contest, which invites only stations participating in
the contest to call. On phone, it is the custom to say &quot;this is&quot;
before your call sign. On CW the code &quot;DE&quot; is used. During
contests, the CQ call is abbreviated by deleting &quot;this is&quot;
before your call sign because it is implied by the format of a CQ
call. On phone, the end code commonly used is &quot;over&quot; or
&quot;standing by for your call&quot;. The end code is not necessary
and is usually deleted for contest calls. On CW, the code &quot;K&quot;
is used to end the CQ call. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On
FM repeaters calling CQ is sometimes discouraged. Don't let this
deter you. CQ is the only invitation for any station to call. Use of
&quot;listening&quot; and &quot;monitoring&quot; in place of a CQ
call is ambiguous. There is a procedure for transmitting an
invitation to communicate - calling CQ. You will always be correct
when you use it. </FONT>

<H2 CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OPERATING
QRP</FONT></H2>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">QRP,
from the Q-signal which means reduce your power, emphasizes the
challenge of low power operation as an alternative to the use of high
power stations. Originally, QRP meant amateur radio operation with a
power level of 5 watts or less, but today QRP operators, called
QRPers, embrace more than just low power. They construct their own
rigs, operate using alternative energy sources, operate in the
wilderness with backpack rigs, compete in QRP contests, cherish CW,
experiment with antennas, and carry on the traditions of amateur
radio which emphasize experimentation and rolling your own equipment.
Defined simply, QRP is doing more with less, by building your own
equipment, getting it on the air, and making contacts using low
power. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To a
QRPer, doing more with less is the main objective, but why would any
ham willingly confine himself to operate with low power? If you make
it difficult to communicate, where's the fun? This is a common
reaction of high power hams. If you think that 100 watts is low
power, you will be amazed at what you can accomplish with 5 watts. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While
most QRPers use low power for the fun and challenge, there are
practical reasons for QRP. First, is the need to reduce interference.
If you live in a modern townhome or apartment, QRP may be the only
way to get on the air without interfering with your neighbor's
appliances. A second reason is the simplicity of the homebrew QRP
rig. Simple QRP CW transceivers can be easily constructed using
readily available parts. These rigs provide the thrill of making
contacts using equipment you personally designed and constructed. A
low cost CW QRP rig can get you on the air for a lot less than an
expensive commercial transceiver. Even if the performance is poor,
the thrill is greater when you make a contact using a homebrew rig. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">QRPers
embrace alternate energy operation in a big way. A QRO (high power)
rig is useless during an emergency when commercial power is out. QRP
has a big advantage here, because it uses emergency power sparingly,
and encourages use of alternative noncommercial power sources such as
solar or wind power. A simple QRP emergency station power source can
be implemented using a automobile battery and a charger. QRP
operation with battery power is an excellent emergency solution,
because QRP conserves energy for longer operation by doing more with
less. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">QRP
contesting is one way QRPers test the effectiveness of their
stations. QRP Field Day operation highlights the effectiveness of
emergency operation at QRP power levels. But, QRP contests are also
lots of fun. QRP contests contrast the competitive, frenetic, high
interference environment of big contests with an enjoyable contest
experience. If you are disgusted by high power, fast paced, QRO
contests, then try QRP. The pace is slower, the contacts friendlier,
and the experience is positively rewarding. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Combining
another hobby with amateur radio is one way we can enhance the
enjoyment of our hobby. QRPers have pioneered the combination of
backpacking and QRP to create a wilderness amateur radio experience.
The objective is to backpack your QRP portable station to a
wilderness mountaintop and see how far you can work. Wilderness
operation encourages innovative low power rigs which operate
efficiently from battery or solar power. Since weight is important,
this type of operation encourages light simple rigs, with a minimum
of accessories, and efficient wire antennas. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As
you may have surmised, almost all QRP operation is via CW. This does
not mean that QRPers do not operate QRP on SSB, but just that CW
operation is a more effective way to accomplish the QRP goal of doing
more with less. Simple low cost CW rigs, built by QRPers, are easily
constructed for CW operation, while SSB rigs are more complex,
costly, and difficult to construct. QRP contests are mainly CW
affairs, while QRP nets are mostly all designed for CW. If you would
like to participate in a net, but are not interested in traffic
handling, QRP nets provide a means to learn net operation, and
upgrade your code speed, while testing the effectiveness of your QRP
station. Finally, your CW QRP experience will teach you one of the
best lessons of amateur radio, you will learn to cherish CW because
it is fun. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As
you may have guessed by now, QRPers don't like big towers and huge
beams. Doing more with less means that QRPers like to get the most
from simple wire antennas. Large loop antennas are popular along with
dipoles, and long wires. QRPers like to get their antennas up high in
the air and experiment with wire beams. Backpack QRPers like this
approach because there is lots of room for big wire beams in the
wilderness. QRPers also use indoor attic antennas. Despite what you
might think, indoor attic dipoles work well with QRP. The author has
worked New Zealand two way QRP - meaning both stations were operating
QRP - using an attic dipole. He also works mobile QRP, a real
challenge. For those who want to try something different, working CW
QRP mobile is great fun, particularly when you are working DX. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before
you can enjoy the fun and challenge of QRP, you have to upgrade to
general. You will find QRPers operating on the following CW
frequencies:</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>3560,
7040, 14060, 21060 and 28060 kHz.</B></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Check
out QRP net operation, by checking into the NEN QRP Net which meets
on Saturday mornings at 8:00 AM on 7040 KHz. QRP contests are
announced in QST and other magazines, look to see when one is
scheduled. The most popular contests are the QRP ARCI spring and fall
contests which occur in April and October. QRP is great fun. Don't be
put off by the idea that low power operation is difficult. Many
QRPers operate at milliwatt and microwatt power levels. Remember that
you can do it with patience, and persistence. QRP adds to the fun of
ham radio, you are welcome to join in. </FONT>

E PROPAGATION</FONT></H2>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Looking
for excitement? Would you like to operate VHF on low power with small
antennas, yet be capable of transmitting half way across the country
with 40dB over S9 signals? Are you thinking about selling your 10
meter rig, because the low ebb of the sunspot cycle has caused 10
meters to fade out? If you are at least a technician class licensee,
you need to know about sporadic E propagation as an answer to these
questions. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a
technician, you may think that you can't enjoy the excitement of HF
propagation. How can you work distant states when you are mostly
restricted to the HF and VHF frequency bands above 28 MHz? All the
excitement of HF long distance propagation is available to you on the
six and ten meter bands through sporadic E propagation. With low
power rigs of only 10 watts, and simple antennas, you can work states
1,000 miles away. This propagation mode keeps 10 meters hopping
during the bottom of the sunspot cycle. Sporadic E can enhance the
excitement and fun of amateur radio, here's how. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sporadic
E is a propagation mode which occurs due to the ionization of the E
region of the ionosphere. The ionization occurs in an unpredictable
sporadic manner, hence the name sporadic E. The ionization when it
occurs is very intense and is capable of reflecting VHF radio waves
for distances up to 1,000 miles in a single hop. Frequencies across
the spectrum from low HF to high VHF can be propagated using the
sporadic E mode, but the effects are the most dramatic on 10, 6, and
2 meters. Yes, you can use sporadic E on 2 meters to work long
distances beyond line of sight. Because the ionization is very
intense, signals are very strong, even when low power is used with
low gain antennas. To exploit the advantages of sporadic E, you need
to know when it occurs. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Studies
show that sporadic E is not random. It occurs most frequently during
the months of May, June, July and August. Frequency plots show that
it peaks in June and then again in December, but the December peak is
rather weak. Sporadic E primarily occurs during the summer months.
That is when you should be looking for it. Sporadic E also occurs
during certain times of the day. There are two periods of activity,
during the morning from about 9:00 AM to noon local time, and from
about 6:00 to 9:00 PM in the evening. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sporadic
E is not affected by sunspots. Band openings are always possible
during the summer beginning in May. You should look for them, and
call CQ occasionally even when the band seems dead. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Set
your squelch to monitor for calls. On 10 meters, try scanning with
your squelch on between 28.300 and 28.500 MHz for SSB or call on
29.600 MHz for FM. On 6 meters, tune to the calling frequency 50.125
MHz for SSB or 52.525 MHz for FM. When the band is open, the
excitement begins.</FONT>
