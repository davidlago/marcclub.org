	<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">ARRL Field Day is the single
	most popular on-the-air event held annually in the US and Canada. On
	<I><B>June 23 and 24, 2012</B></I>, more than 35,000 American and
	Canadian radio amateurs will gather with their clubs, groups or
	simply with friends to operate from remote locations. Members and
	friends of the <I><B>Montgomery Amateur Radio Club </B></I>will set
	up operations at the Davis Airport, a family-owned country air strip

	<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Field Day is a time where many
	aspects of Amateur Radio come together to highlight our many roles.
	While some will treat it as a contest, our club uses the opportunity
	to practice our emergency response capabilities. It is an excellent
	opportunity to demonstrate Amateur Radio to the organizations that
	Amateur Radio might serve in an emergency, as well as the general
	public. For our club, ARRL Field Day is one of the highlights of our
	annual calendar.</FONT></P>

	<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Our objective is simply to
	contact as many other stations as possible and to learn to operate
	our radio gear in abnormal situations and less than optimal
	conditions.</FONT></P>

	<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">We use these same skills when we
	help with events such as marathons and bike-a-thons; fund-raisers
	such as walkathons; celebrations such as parades; and exhibits at
	fairs, malls and museums &mdash; these are all large, preplanned,
	non-emergency activities.</FONT></P>

	<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">But despite the development of
	very complex, modern communications systems &mdash; or maybe because
	they ARE so complex &mdash; ham radio has been called into action
	again and again to provide communications in crises when it really
	matters. Amateur Radio Operators (also called &ldquo;hams&rdquo;)

	<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Often called &ldquo;ham radio,&rdquo;
	the Amateur Radio Service has been around for a century. In that
	time, it&rsquo;s grown into a worldwide community of licensed
	operators using the airwaves with every conceivable means of
	communications technology. Hams range in age from youngsters to
	grandparents. Even rocket scientists and a rock star or two are in
	the ham ranks. Most, however, are just normal folks like you and me
	who enjoy learning and being able to transmit voice, data and
	pictures through the air to unusual places, both near and far,
	without depending on commercial systems.</FONT></P>

	<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The Amateur Radio frequencies

Message from the MARC 2012 Field Day Committee Chair
 
Thank you all for the quick and voluminous responses to my call for help
in transporting our new 10 meter antenna down from near Reading PA.
Dave W2LNX and I will be going up to pick up the antenna as soon
as the owner takes it down. Again, appreciate all of the offers.
Looking forward to a great field day with a large body of members
participating in the event.
 
Best 73 and see you all at the next meeting, Wednesday May 2,
for the first of 4 successive meetings containing presentations
and activities supporting our field day preparations.
 
Phil, K3EW

<u>Message from Sid Caesar, NH7C, MARC PIO</u>
<p>The coordination of all of the MARC 2012 Field Day activities is essential to having a successful weekend.

<p>The coordination of Field Day visitors, including Scouting groups, elected officials, public safety departments, ARRL officials, and other guests, is the responsibility of the MARC Public Information Officer: Sid Caesar, NH7C. Sid is engaged in our MARC Field Day messaging efforts, and will be the point of contact for the MARC Field Day messaging and visitor coordination.

<p>Groups interested in joining the MARC Field Day will need to coordinate with Sid to assure space and staff to support their group. MARC will be focused on the Field Day operation and the public relations elements of Field Day, so any extra support, like Scouting Merit Badges or other presentations, will need to be supported by the visiting group.

<hr width="60%"> 
 
<p>Sid will coordinate with MARC members to assure MARC staffing levels
to support all of the visits to the MARC Field Day site. MARC members who
would like to assist with hosting our visitors should contact Sid
to volunteer. Sid NH7C can be reached

</script>
<noscript>(see website Contact Info)</noscript> or call
<script type="text/javascript"> pnumb( "240", "453", "9446" ); </script>
<noscript>(enable javascript)</noscript> (Home).

<p>Finally, as Chair, I still need some folks to step forward to assist in
the management of the Field Day Logistics - extremely important to successful
feeding and hydration of our setup, tear down crews,<br>
and to our operators.
Please contact me directly 
<script type="text/javascript">

</script>
<noscript>(see website Contact Info)</noscript> or call
<script type="text/javascript"> pnumb( "301", "266", "6666" ); </script>

Thank you and best 73
