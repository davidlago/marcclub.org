HEY GANG,
 
W3AO averaged 500 qso's per each of their ( including 8 donated) fancy
ICOM rigs.  We averaged 400 ( not including GOTA) which brings us up to about
same 500 qso's per rig that W3AO averaged.  We have much to be proud of guys
and gals!!!!  WHAT AN EFFORT FOR THE MARC TEAM!!!  We did fabulously as a club
as 2A!!!!!  With all of our bonus points we definitely will score very well
compared to other 2A's: Vis. satellite QSO, a la Steve Davis, our bonus point
maven N3QYI, and on and on and on to include every operator and site erector
who were a part of TEAM MARC.
 
The amount of technical information exchange between all of the participants
was truly astounding. You could not help to learn something new from each
of the conversations which were ongoing much of the entire weekend. Thank you
to the Lees for their wonderfully nutritious and tasty food which kept our
spirits and sugar levels high ( Probably one of the greatest factors in our
ability to sustain the superior effort we did throughout the contest).
 
Thank you to all for your fantastic support and efforts at this year's
Field Day. I am looking forward to doing it again next year and so is
the airport owner!!.
 
Best 73 to all- have a safe 4th and see you all at our next meeting on
July 6th.
 
Respectfully
Phil Barsky, K3EW

This is the weekend for the Field Day 2011.  It's the most popular

Everyone is invited to operate as long as they wish into the night.
Coffee pot will be kept percolating.  We will have operations humming
