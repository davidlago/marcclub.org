of the MARC Repeaters
</div>

<p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li>If you have questions about the use of the repeaters, <b>please ask</b>.<br>
FCC Part 97 rules apply <b>AT ALL TIMES</b>.<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Listen</b> for at least 10 seconds before transmitting to be sure the repeater is not already in use<br> or <b>ask</b> "Is the repeater in use?".<br>&nbsp;

<li>In accordance with FCC requirements, the repeater has a <b>timer</b> set for slightly less than three minutes.<br> Resetting of the timer is indicated by a <b>courtesy tone</b>. <b>WAIT</b> for the tone before transmitting.<br>&nbsp;

<li>If you wish to join a conversation in progress, <b>wait</b> until the end of a transmission
and give your <b>call sign</b> promptly.<br>
There is a short delay between the end of a transmission and the <b>courtesy tone</b>.<br>
Stations already in conversation <b>wait</b> for the <b>courtesy tone</b> before transmitting.<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>If you need access to the repeater for an emergency transmission, say
"<font style="text-decoration: underline">EMERGENCY</font>"</b><br>
and give your <b>call sign</b> when you break into an ongoing conversation.<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Do not use</b> "<font style="text-decoration: underline">break</font>" or "<font style="text-decoration: underline">break break</font>" since they have special meaning for most operators<br>
and usage varies around the U.S. <b>Use "<font style="text-decoration: underline">EMERGENCY</font>"</b> or your <b>call sign</b>.<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Always allow a breaking station to transmit immediately</b>.<br>
Allow a station an opportunity to report emergencies or ask for directions or other assistance.<br>
This is particularly important during commuting periods and periods of bad weather when the need<br>
for emergency assistance calls are most likely.<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Avoid business talk</b> (FCC Part 97 rules). When in doubt,
<b><font style="text-decoration: underline">DON'T</font></b>.<br>&nbsp;

<li>Remember Amateur frequencies are <b>not private lines</b> - what you say on the repeater<br>
can and will be heard by many people (including the FCC). <b>Always assume you have an audience</b>.<br>&nbsp;

<li>Do not say things that may offend others who may be listening. Be circumspect in discussing private<br>
personal family affairs on the repeater. Do not "advertise" your house will be unoccupied during vacations, etc.<br>&nbsp;

<li>The repeater gives its own <b>ID</b>. <b>You must also identify</b> your station by giving your <b>call sign</b> every 10 minutes<br>
during a conversation and at the end of your participation. You do not have to identify the other stations<br>
nor do you have to identify yourself with every transmission.<br>&nbsp;

<li><b>Monitor</b> the repeater. Members or visitors may call for assistance.<br>
Visitors may just want a friendly conversation on the way through the Washington area.<br>&nbsp;

<li>If you hear what you believe to be <b>deliberate interference</b>, do not attempt to communicate<br>
with the interfering station. Switch to the repeater input frequency and, if you can hear the signal,<br>
record the following information for use in locating the source:
  <ol>
  <li>signal strength
  <li>your location
  <li>date and time
  <li>your antenna and receiver
  <li>and characteristics of the RF, audio or voice that might help in identification
  </ol><br>
Report the information to a member of the Board of Directors or the Repeater Committee.<br>
<b>Do not discuss interference incidents on the air</b>.<br>&nbsp;

<li>While the 146.355/146.955 MHz repeater pair is exclusive in this area, there may be times when other<br>
repeaters may be heard. Propagation conditions are occasionally such that we will hear the 146.955 output<br>
signals from other repeaters. The 146.355 input signals from stations in other repeater service areas will<br>
sometimes bring up our repeater. Our use of the minimum power necessary to access our repeater will help<br>
minimize interference with our neighbors. <b>Be tolerant</b> of the annoyances resulting from these unusual conditions.
