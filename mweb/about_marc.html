<br>

MARC has adopted the Amateur's Code and applies it to all activities
including meetings and the repeaters.<br>
<br>
THE AMATEUR'S CODE - The Radio Amateur is:<br>
<br>
CONSIDERATE... never knowingly operates in such a way as to lessen the
pleasure of others.<br>
<br>
LOYAL... offers loyalty, encouragement and support to other amateurs, local
clubs, and the American Radio Relay League, through which Amateur Radio in
the United States is represented nationally and internationally.<br>
<br>
PROGRESSIVE... with knowledge abreast of science, a well-built and
efficient station and operation above reproach.<br>
<br>
FRIENDLY... slow and patient operating when requested; friendly advice and
counsel to the beginner; kindly assistance, cooperation and consideration
for the interests of others.  These are the hallmarks of the amateur spirit.<br>
<br>
BALANCED... radio is an avocation, never interfering with duties owed to
family, job, school, or community.<br>
<br>
PATRIOTIC... station and skill always ready for service to country and
community.<br>
<br>
The original Amateur's Code was written by Paul M. Segal, W9EEA, in 1928.<br>
