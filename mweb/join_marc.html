You do not have to be a member of MARC to attend meetings or to use the MARC repeater.
<br><br>
We do, however, invite you to join us by simply filling out an application form
and paying the proper membership dues shown on the form at the time of
application. This can be done at any meeting or mail your application and dues to:<br>

<br><br>

<table class="a14">

   <tr>

      <td width="60"/>

      <td>
         MARC<br>
         P.O. Box 611<br>
         Gaithersburg, MD 20884-0611<br>
      </td>

   </tr>

</table>

<br><br>

Your application must be presented by the membership committee to the membership
at two meetings (usually the two immediately following receipt of the application)
to be voted into the club. Upon becoming a member, you will receive a Directory
of MARC members and a membership card.

repeater autopatch.
